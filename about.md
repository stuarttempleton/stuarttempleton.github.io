I am a game designer with a focus on exploratory user experiences and innovative prototypes. I thrive at the intersection of art and technology, realizing unique and creative visions through technical tools like Unity3D and visual tools like Blender and Photoshop. 

I have 17 years of industry experience and have shipped over 30 titles in a variety of roles.I have a deep love for MMORPGs and games that are social and collaborative experiences, as well as a passion for exploration. I am a solid raid leader

I value revolution over evolution.
