I'm **Stuart**. I sometimes go by **Voltur** or **Voltur5** on social media.

I've had a pretty cool journey, so far. I've been a professional musician, a radio personality, a nefarious hacker, a game developer, a game designer, a comic writer, a filmmaker, and an interactive fiction writer.

Most of my stuff probably isn't for you, and that's ok. Really! It's ok! I intentionally break rules and deviate from best practices to explore the media I work with, and sometimes that means that folks don't "get it." I tend to focus on exploration and creating a deep personal experience with *something*. 

I like and appreciate connecting with people, so come say hi on social media! 

I value revolution over evolution.
