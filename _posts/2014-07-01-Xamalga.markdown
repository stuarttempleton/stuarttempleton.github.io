### Technologies and Challenges

Xamalga was built using the Cocos2d-x engine using a core of C++. The music and audio features were created using Objective-C and Java for the iOS and Android platforms. The audio feature pulled audio data directly from the system library, Google Music and iTunes, and dynamically established complexity and difficulty for each song. Though the game isn't rythm-based, it derived all of the unique gameplay elements directly from the music.
