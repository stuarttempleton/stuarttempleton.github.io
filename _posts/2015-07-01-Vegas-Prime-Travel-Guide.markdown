### Purpose and Function
The Travel Guide served primarily as an engine proof of concept. We wanted to validate some of the smaller parts of our game, like controller input, by letting our existing fans play with it. While not a game, per se, it served to keep our fans interested in Vegas Prime while we continued developing the game.

### Technologies and Challenges

The Vegas Prime Travel Guide is built primarily with C# in Unity3D. Because this was an engine proof of concept, it uses both in-house assets and publically available city assets.
