Play as a humble chronologist, fixing and replacing clocks. Each clock has the potential to make a positive or negative impact on the recipients lives.

### Exploring Alternative Mechanisms

This project was built during the 48hr Global Game Jam 2020. I wanted to explore using interactive fiction to create a game that relies on empathy rather than reaction time, strategy, or puzzle solving. The result is an interesting look into an intensely personal experience as you use your empathy as the mechanism to move a game forward.

### Technologies

The Chronologist was built in Twine 2.3.2 with Harlowe.
