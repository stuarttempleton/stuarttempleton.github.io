# Hi! I'm Stuart and this is my website.
This site exists somewhere between a blog and a portfolio, letting me trim everything back and just show off things I'm working on -- mostly fiction.

It is made with Jekyll and hosted with github pages. I figure if you're here, I should probably tell you that.
