Here are some writing samples that cover NPC barks in a variety of cases. I've selected examples that demonstrate how I have used relatively simple barks to convey character and world personality as well as provide meaningful feedback to the player.

## NO CARRIER
<a href="/portfolio/images/nocarrier/no_carrier_bark-web.jpg"><img src="/portfolio/images/nocarrier/no_carrier_bark-web.jpg" alt="No Carrier" class="inline_floating_images"/></a>

NO CARRIER is the hacker antagonist in Vegas Prime Retrograde. She hacks into the player's communication link and taunts her periodically during hacking challenges, based on player progress. Her outward personality is reminiscent of classic anime villains and her bark interactions are inspired by the dog in Duck Hunt. I produced the audio, working with voice actor Beth Cartwright. Here are some highlights:

<ul class="portfolio_item">
    <li>[Taunt Failure] "You're going to try to take MY bundle? NO CARRIER? On PrimeNet?! Hahaha! It's your funeral."<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/nocarrier/CITY 1 FAIL.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Taunt Failure] "Let me let you in on a little secret: You'll never beat me. I'm the best."<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/nocarrier/CITY 5 FAIL.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Taunt Failure] "Hahaha! You're going to have to do better than that if you want to beat ME."<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/nocarrier/CITY 6 FAIL.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Taunt Epic Failure] "Like taking data from a baby! Can we do another?"<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/nocarrier/CITY 7 FAIL.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Taunt Epic Failure] "Oh hey, thanks! I was really worried you were going to get that one! But then you tanked. Hugs and kisses!"<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/nocarrier/CITY 8 FAIL.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Taunt Success] "Ok, ok. That was pretty good. Time to step up my game, I guess."<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/nocarrier/CITY 7 COMPLETE.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Taunt Success] "Oh look! You got an easy one! Congratulations."<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/nocarrier/CITY 8 COMPLETE.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Taunt Epic Success] "Oh, you want REAL competition? Incoming, bitch! You're going down!"<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/nocarrier/CITY 10 COMPLETE.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Taunt Epic Success] "Aww how cute! Clara got one! Good luck, sucker. I'm back up."<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/nocarrier/CITY 14 COMPLETE.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Taunt Epic Success] "You think you're working for the good guys, don't you? Ugh. Typical!"<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/nocarrier/CITY 12 COMPLETE.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
</ul>

## Clara
CLARA is the player character in Vegas Prime Retrograde. I wrote ambient voice lines to convey personality and environmental information to the player, revealing how connected the character is with the world she is exploring. These barks appear only as ambient audio during game play. I produced the audio, working with voice actor Shereena Sylvester. Here are some key samples:

<ul class="portfolio_item">
    <li>[Discovers Lounge Area] "A lounge! Swanky stasis bay!"<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/clara/alounge_bip.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Enters Cryo Room] "*shivers* Cold."<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/clara/cold_bip.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Target Out of Range] "I'm going to need a bigger antenna, if I'm going to hack that from here."<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/clara/biggerantenna_bip.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Target Out of Range Variant] "I need to get closer."<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/clara/ineedtogetcloser_bip.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Action Failure] "Hmmm..."<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/clara/hmm_bip.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Missing Key] "Hmmm... Locked."<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/clara/hmmlocked_bip.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Refuses Action] "Nope."<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/clara/nope_bip.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
    <li>[Refuses Action Variant] "I can't do that."<br/>
    <audio src="/portfolio/audio_samples/clara/icantdothat_bip.mp3" controls></audio>
    </li>
</ul>

<i>Note: I also designed and implemented the ambient audio system that plays Clara's environmental barks, which you can read about in <a href="/blog/2018/04/02/character-audio-manager/">this blog post</a>.</i>
