## Character Design in Vegas Prime Retrograde

I was tasked with designing and bringing to life a rich protagonist, antagonist, and supporting cast for the central story line of Vegas Prime Retrograde. 

I created two characters: Clara and NO CARRIER. These characters, despite being on different sides of the story, share a duality in their troubled relationship with the world around them. I use this to create a space of character exploration for the player. Examining each character within the story allows for reflection on the other.

With a small team of strong creative talent, I was able to design and realize a strong protagonist and antagonist capable of leading a rich cast of side-characters and ultimately feeding a meaningful, character-driven narrative.

## Clara, the Protagonist

The bulk of Clara's personality is derived from the player's decisions during the game, so she needed to be open enough to hold the player's vision of who Clara is. I gave her mild, yet endearing personality traits, like compassion and optimism, while avoiding polarizing traits that might impact decision trees without the player's permission.

I provided the character sketch and concept art and worked directly with illustrator Fabian Cobos to create the final artwork.

Though Clara does not visually appear in dialog, it is still important for her to appear. In addition to appearing on the title menu, I also have her appear on the game settings screen. Viewing game settings is looking inward to the game, and when the player looks inward, I want them to see Clara.

## NO CARRIER, the Antagonist

I modeled some of NO CARRIER's outward personality on classic anime villains, an homage to Ranma 1/2. The villains in Ranma were often simply misunderstood or otherwise regular people clouded by a sense of self preservation or entitlement.

I wanted NO CARRIER's personality to fit into the ludo-narrative in a natural way. To do this, I took inspiration from the villainous dog in Duck Hunt. NO CARRIER will hack into your COM and taunt you while she delivers hints and backstory.

At several points, it becomes unclear as to if NO CARRIER is the villain, or if she has been maligned. This allows the player to further explore the protagonist Clara's relationship to the story and the world at large.
